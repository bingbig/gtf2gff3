# gtf2gff3
Convert gtf to gff3 for JBrowse

### Note
1. Many attributes and features are removed
2. "transcript" will be replaced by 'mRNA'

#### About this
I found that many tools are not friendly to JBrowse (It seems JBrwose works better with gff3 than gtf), so I wrote a very simple one, but it works.
Feel free to use.
